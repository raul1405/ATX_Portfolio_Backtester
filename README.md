**Sharpe-optimal ATX portfolio backtester** using long-only SLSQP optimization, leveraging a costum lookback timeframe.
Leverages **Bayesian covariance shrinkage** (factor + sample, CV-tuned) and compares the optimized portfolio against a **user-defined allocation** and the **ATX benchmark**.
Outputs full **risk/return metrics** (Sharpe, IR, alpha/beta, drawdown) and generates **equity-curve plots** for clear performance visualization.
